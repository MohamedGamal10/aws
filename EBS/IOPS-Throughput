# EBS â€“ Measure the IOPS and Throughput of EBS volume

# IOPs (Input/Output Operations Per Second)
    - IOPs measures the number of discrete I/O operations (read or write commands),
      a storage device or system can complete in one second.

    - Higher IOPs indicate the ability to handle more individual requests per second, 
      which is essential for applications requiring quick access to a large number of small files or database transactions.

# Throughput
    - Throughput measures the amount of data (in MB/s, GB/s, etc.) a storage system can transfer in one second.

    - High throughput is crucial for applications that transfer large files, like media streaming or backup operations.


# Choosing Between IOPs and Throughput

    - High IOPs is preferable for workloads like OLTP (Online Transaction Processing), 
      where there are many small transactions.

    - High throughput is preferable for applications like data warehousing or video streaming,
      where large, continuous data transfers are common.
